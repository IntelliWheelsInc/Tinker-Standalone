A tighter seat width provides a sleeker appearance and increases your lateral stability. It also gives you easier access to the push rims. TiArrow uses a thin tube to outline the shape of the side guard, however. This adds rigidity to the frame and increases your lateral stability, but it also makes the frame fit your body a little differently. We suggest choosing a seat width that is .5? wider than you would otherwise get to ensure a comfortable fit.",
